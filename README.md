# ðŸ¤–Cognitive Assistance Chatbot ðŸ’¬ 
Welcome to part of the backened development of Cognitive Assistance Chatbot by OpenFabric! This chatbot is designed to provide users with quick and accurate answers to science-related questions using advanced NLP technology.

## Introduction
This chatbot is an AI solution for those seeking fast and accurate answers to science-related questions. Our chatbot utilizes advanced NLP technology to process user queries and provide relevant answers in real-time. It is powered by the BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model, which is trained on a massive amount of text data and can provide highly accurate responses to a wide range of science-related questions. The chatbot is implemented in Python using the transformers library by Hugging Face.

## Usage
To use the chatbot, simply input a science-related question followed by a context (i.e., a text snippet containing the information needed to answer the question), separated by the delimiter |||. The chatbot will process your query and generate an answer.

For example, the following input would generate a response to the question "What is the atomic number of carbon?":

What is the atomic number of carbon? ||| The atomic number of carbon is 6.

## Running the App
